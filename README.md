## Things to improve:
Hand pivot points. Making the pivot points further away from the body will increase the range of motion.
Currently the motor's range of motion covers 90 degrees. Increasing the motor's range will help improve with the precision of finger movement.
Adapting the tracking to work at a wider range of distances. Maybe converting to angles instead of X,Y coordinates will help with the change.
